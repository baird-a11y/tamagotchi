# Tamagotchi

Welcome to the Tamagotchi project! This project is a digital pet simulation game where you can take care of your virtual pet by feeding, playing, and cleaning up after it. This is just a fun project for me to learn how I can connect my computer and smartphone via a Raspberry Pi.

## Features

- **Feed your pet:** Keep your pet healthy by feeding it regularly.
- **Play with your pet:** Ensure your pet stays happy by playing games with it.
- **Clean up:** Maintain your pet's environment by cleaning up after it.
- **Monitor health:** Keep an eye on your pet's health, happiness, and hunger levels.
